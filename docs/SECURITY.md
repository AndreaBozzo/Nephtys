## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Nephtys, please report it privately:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainers or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue.

## Security Considerations

When using Nephtys:

- **NATS Credentials**: Never commit NATS authentication credentials to version control
- **Stream Sources**: Be cautious when connecting to untrusted WebSocket or stream endpoints
- **API Access**: Consider placing the REST API behind a reverse proxy with authentication in production
- **Dependencies**: Keep Go dependencies updated with `go get -u ./...`

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security issue is fixed, we will:
1. Release a patch
2. Publish a security advisory
3. Credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity)
